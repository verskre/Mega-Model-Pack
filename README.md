# Mega-Model-Pack
This is a project I have to recreate every single prop used on every single map in Teardown.  

This list will update as i update the mod and add more models. Right now there are more than 3000 models! 3054 to be exact. Credit me if you'd like too, the models aren't mine. But you can credit either me or Tuxedo Labs.

## Features

Manually Remade props from every map
Components of structures found in story mode
Highly modifiable and modular
